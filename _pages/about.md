I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Case Western Reserve University. I received my PhD in Mathematics from Tufts University in 2018 advised by [Prof. Todd Quinto](https://sites.tufts.edu/tquinto/) and was co-advised by [Prof. Venky Krishnan, (TIFR India)] (http://math.tifrbng.res.in/~vkrishnan/). Before joining Case, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UNC Charlotte (2021-2023) working at the intersection of inverse problems, statistics and machine learning with [Prof. Taufiquar Khan](https://pages.charlotte.edu/tkhan13/). Before that, I was a visiting Assistant Profeesor (2018-2021) at Drexel University and worked with [Prof. Shari Moskow](https://www.math.drexel.edu/~moskow/). <br>

My main research interests are 
-  Statistical Inverse Problems
-  Integral Geometry and Microlocal Analysis
-  Machine Learning
